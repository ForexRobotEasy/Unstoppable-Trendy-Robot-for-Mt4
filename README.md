## Functionality

The Unstoppable Trendy Robot utilizes various trading strategies to identify and capitalize on trending market conditions. It incorporates trend identification, entry logic, exit logic, and money management techniques to optimize trading performance.

### Trend Identification

The `TrendIdentification()` function uses Bollinger Bands to filter ranging markets and identify trending market conditions. It determines the strength and direction of the trend and returns these values.

### Entry Logic

The `EntryLogic()` function identifies optimal buying and selling zones using support and resistance levels. It incorporates the identified entry points into the trading strategy and executes trades based on these points.

### Exit Logic

The `ExitLogic()` function implements effective exit strategies to maximize profits and minimize risks. It determines exit points based on predefined criteria, such as trailing stops or target profit levels, and closes trades at these points.

### Money Management

The `MoneyManagement()` function incorporates proper money management techniques to control risk and protect capital. It calculates position sizes based on account balance, risk tolerance, and risk-reward ratios, and returns the calculated position size.

### Main Function

The `OnTick()` function is the main function that drives the trading strategy. It calls the trend identification function, and if the trend strength is positive, it executes the entry logic. It then proceeds to the exit logic and money management sections. After that, it is up to the user to implement the necessary trade functions using the trend-based strategy. Lastly, it closes all open positions and exits the program by calling the `CloseAll()` function.

### Close All Open Positions

The `CloseAll()` function is responsible for closing all open positions. However, the implementation of this function is not provided in the code and needs to be implemented separately.
